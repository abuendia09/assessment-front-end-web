             <h4 class="about-headers">Career Goal</h4>
                <p>My one career goal right now is to be able to start as an entry level front-end web developer
                    and be able to work remote and travel the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually I would love to start my own website development company in Panama.
                    I have been able to notice how much work the websites down there need and it would be amazing
                    to jump on the opportunity to exploit that market.
